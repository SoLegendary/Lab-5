file \hyperlink{_flash_8c}{Flash.\+c}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Functions to control writing and erasing of the Flash memory module of the K70 Tower These functions allocate memory for and allow the programming of said memory in the Flash module. This is done via Launch\+Command calls which write or erase the necessary bytes via the F\+C\+C\+OB register. Note that for Lab 2, only one Phrase (8 bytes) maximum may be allocated at a time. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item

\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Routines for setting up the Flex\+Timer module (F\+TM) on the T\+W\+R-\/\+K70\+F120M. The F\+TM is primarily used for timing the L\+E\+Ds, allowing them to be turned on and off automatically. Eg. Having a blue L\+ED turn on for 1s whenever a valid packet is received. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item
